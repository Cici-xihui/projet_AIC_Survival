<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<h3>Introduction of the problem</h3>

<p>
The problem is a regression problem. The goal is to predict the time a patient survives after his admission in a hospital. To 
do so, each sample (aka each patient) is characterized by the following information:
 <ul>
    <li> Age
    <li> Ethnicity (with a one-hot representation)
    <li> Gender
    <li> Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
    <li> Glycated hemoglobin concentration
    <li> Body Mass Index (or BMI)
</ul>

This give you a total of 10 features to predict the following couple:
<ul>
  <li> Target: the survival time to predict
  <li> Event: if the data is censored (the patient left the study or the study stopped too early) 1 else 0
</ul>

You are given for training a data matrix X_train of dimension 19297 x 10 and an array y_train of labels of dimension 19297 x 2. You must train a model which predicts the labels for two test matrices X_valid and X_test.

<h3>Evaluation metric</h3>

<p>
To evaluate the performance of your model, you will need a metric: <b>the concordance index</b>. The formula is: 

<br><br>
In other word, the concordance index is a “global” index for validating the predictive ability of a survival model. It is the fraction of pairs in your data, where the observation with the higher survival time has the higher probability of survival predicted by your model.

<br><br>
The index is not calculated for every observation/subject. So the c-index can not be interpreted as the risk of a subject. High values mean that your model predicts higher probabilities of survival for higher observed survival times.
</p>

<h3>Different steps</h3>

<p>
There are 2 phases:
<ul>
<li> <b>Phase 1: development phase. </b> We provide you with labeled training data and unlabeled validation and test data.
Make predictions for both datasets. However, you will receive feed-back on your performance on the validation set only. 
The performance of your LAST submission will be displayed on the leaderboard.
<li> <b>Phase 2: final phase.</b> You do not need to do anything. Your last submission of phase 1 will be automatically forwarded.
Your performance on the test set will appear on the leaderboard when the organizers finish checking the submissions. 
</ul>

During all this sample competition, you are allowed to submit either:
<ul>
<li> Only prediction results (no code)
<li> A pre-trained prediction model
<li> A prediction model that must be trained and tested 
</ul>

The submissions are evaluated using the above metric: <b>the concordance index</b>.
