<h1>Solve Survival Analysis Problem</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by the Survival Team</h3>
<p>In this challenge we try to tackle a survival analysis problem from a machine learning perspective. The goal of survival 
  analysis is to predict the expected time before a given event occur. In our case we try to estimate the survival time of 
  patients given some data from the NHANES dataset.</p>
